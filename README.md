# DDM1-OpenEvents-v2

The OpenEvents V2 project is a cross-cutting project between three subjects of second in the degree in Software Application Techniques aimed at develop full-stack knowledge. During the development of this project a functional API, a web page with the necessary components will be programmed and a mobile application.

Specifically for the subject of mobile application development, the challenge is based on creating an application that is simple, functional and practical. The main functionalities that the application must have are the following:

  - Creation and management of events
  - Search and registration of attendees for the different events
  - Score and comments on past events
  - Connection between friends within the community
